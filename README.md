# KanjiPracticeDemo

First demo of an app to practice Japanese Kanji.  

You can learn the pictograms main meaning and their 'On' and 'Kun' readings. Also, there are 3 common words that contain that Kanji.

To pratice its writing you can draw strokes in the bottom panel. If the stroke you draw match with the correct one it will show in the panel and you can keep drawing strokes.

If you have any feedback can reach me out at dan.iniestagon@gmail.com

Cheers!
